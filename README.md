# Mortgage Calculator

This simple script allows the user to enter a number of variables to determine:

==>The monthly mortgage payments due <br/>
==>How much Interest will be paid in total and monthly<br/>
==>The effect of early payments on the total paid<br/>
==>Time taken to pay loan in total<br/>
==>Crucially - will show a yearly or monthly amortization schedule<br/>

The script runs on the app streamlit - streamlit itself will pick up this script and run on its server, which is found here: https://share.streamlit.io/
